        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Breastfeeding is universally recognized as the primary means of providing optimal nutritional support to infants promoting essential immunological protection and fostering maternal-child bonding. The World Health Organization advocates exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life followed by sustained mixed feeding for at least two years (World Health Organization 2023). The physiological process of lactation encompasses two critical phases: lactogenesis I marked by the differentiation of mammary alveolar epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactogenesis II characterized by the active secretion of milk postpartum. Typically lactogenesis II should commence between 48 and 72 hours post-delivery signaling the establishment of effective breastfeeding (Pillay and Davis 2023). However exogenous factors particularly the mode of delivery can significantly disrupt this process. Notably cesarean sections have been identified as a major factor contributing to delayed onset of lactogenesis II (DOLII) affecting a substantial proportion (33.3%) of new mothers (Lian et al. 2022). This delay can lead to consequential infant weight loss and necessitate increased formula supplementation (Huang et al. 2020). Moreover it places mothers at a higher risk for early cessation of breastfeeding often due to associated postoperative pain and limited mobility (Lian et al. 2022).</p>
        <p>In regions like China where cesarean delivery rates are among the highest globally (34.9%)—peaking at 63.9% in Tianjin—addressing the challenges associated with postoperative lactation becomes critical (Betran et al. 2021; Li et al. 2017). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers effective solutions such as press needle acupuncture. This technique involves small intradermal needles typically measuring 0.2 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in length. Designed to penetrate just the epidermis these needles are affixed with a transparent microorganism-impermeable film that prevents deeper tissue penetration and maintains sterility while allowing skin breathability. The simplicity of the press needle system allows it to be safely administered by trained nurses offering sustained acupoint stimulation. This method is particularly suited to managing post-cesarean lactation issues given its minimal risk of complications and ability to provide continuous therapeutic benefits (Li et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2022). Additionally therapeutic breast massage utilized for centuries in various cultures supports lactation by mechanically stimulating the mammary glands improving lymphatic drainage and facilitating the release of oxytocin thus enhancing milk flow and reducing engorgement (Suna Dağ and Yayan 2022). These practices not only mitigate common lactational problems but also significantly alleviate discomfort and improve psychological well-being by promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety (Becker et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Incorporating these TCM modalities into conventional postnatal care could revolutionize the management of breastfeeding difficulties post-cesarean section (Li et al. 2021; Lin et al. 2023). This integrated approach is supported by empirical studies that highlight the positive impact of manual therapies on lactation dynamics and maternal satisfaction (Baker-Fox et al. 2024; Xia et al. 2023). This study aimed to rigorously evaluate the combined effects of press needle acupuncture and breast massage on accelerating the onset of lactogenesis II thereby optimizing breastfeeding outcomes and maternal health post-cesarean delivery.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Method</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Study Design</h3>
        <p>This study adopts a pragmatic parallel-design two-arm randomized controlled exploratory framework. The article's reporting adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.</p>
        
        <h3>2.2 Study Setting, Recruitment, and Ethics</h3>
        <p>This study took place at Qingdao Municipal Hospital from December 2023 to June 2024. It involved 136 first-time mothers who had cesarean sections at this facility along with their healthy single-born infants. First-time mothers were specifically chosen due to their significantly higher likelihood of experiencing delayed lactogenesis II onset compared to multiparas. The research team meticulously selected participants based on detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria thoroughly explained the study's objectives methodologies potential benefits and associated risks to them and obtained written informed consent from each participant after they agreed to partake in the study.</p>
        
        <h3>2.3 Inclusion Criteria</h3>
        <p>Mothers included in the study were required to be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>≥ 18 years old</li>
            <li>Expecting their first live-born child via cesarean delivery</li>
            <li>Having a singleton pregnancy</li>
            <li>Intending to breastfeed with no major contraindications like hepatitis B, HIV, or other infectious diseases</li>
            <li>Had newborns with Apgar scores above 8 at 1-5 minutes, robust sucking reflex, and no neonatal transfer required</li>
            <li>Able to understand and respond to questions independently</li>
            <li>Accessible for follow-up via telephone or WeChat</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.4 Exclusion Criteria</h3>
        <p>Exclusion criteria included mothers who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Had previous breast surgeries like biopsies or augmentations</li>
            <li>Had nipple inversions that complicate breastfeeding</li>
            <li>Were taking medications affecting lactation</li>
            <li>Experienced severe perinatal complications such as serious pre-eclampsia or grade 3 or higher cardiac issues per NYHA standards</li>
            <li>Had severe local skin damage at the acupoint and massage sites</li>
            <li>Had newborns with critical conditions like cardiopulmonary insufficiency, galactosemia, or phenylketonuria</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.5 Randomization and Blinding</h3>
        <p>Participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Allocation concealment was ensured using opaque, sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding of participants and healthcare providers was not feasible. However, outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded to group assignments to minimize bias.</p>
        
        <h3>2.6 Intervention Group</h3>
        <p>On the basis of the control group, press needle acupoint stimulation and breast massage were administered to the intervention group.</p>
        
        <h3>2.7 Control Group</h3>
        <p>Very early skin-to-skin contact was initiated by researchers within 30 to 40 minutes after birth, with newborns optionally wearing caps being placed on the mothers’ chests. Mothers were encouraged to breastfeed 8 to 10 times per day to ensure steady milk production. It was ensured by researchers that mothers completely emptied one breast before switching to the other to maintain cleanliness. Additionally, mothers were guided by researchers on maintaining a well-balanced diet, achieving emotional stability, and securing adequate sleep to facilitate effective breastfeeding.</p>
        
        <h3>2.8 Primary Outcome Measurement</h3>
        <p>The main outcome indicators included the sensation of milk coming in, defined as the time to stage II lactogenesis. Participants were asked to report the approximate time they noticed their breasts feeling 'noticeably fuller' using a numeric scale: 1 indicated 'no change since giving birth', 3 denoted 'noticeably fuller', and 5 represented 'uncomfortably full.' Additionally, milk volume was measured using a breast pump every 12 hours postpartum.</p>
        
        <h3>2.9 Statistical Analysis</h3>
        <p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant characteristics, and inferential statistics were employed to test hypotheses. Continuous variables were analyzed using t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, while categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. A significance level of p<0.05 was set for all statistical tests. All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).</p>
        
        <h2>3. Results</h2>
        <p>Out of the 136 first-time mothers approached for participation, 120 consented and were enrolled in the study. The baseline characteristics of the mothers and infants did not significantly differ between the intervention and control groups, as shown in Table 1.</p>

        </table>
        
        <p>The primary outcome measure was the time to lactogenesis II. The results indicated that mothers in the intervention group experienced lactogenesis II significantly earlier than those in the control group (35.6 ± 6.4 hours vs. 42.8 ± 8.1 hours, p<0.001). Additionally, the intervention group had a significantly higher milk volume at 48 hours postpartum compared to the control group (60.2 ± 20.4 ml vs. 45.3 ± 18.7 ml, p=0.002).</p>
        
        <h2>4. Discussion</h2>
        <p>The findings from this study suggest that press needle acupuncture combined with breast massage significantly accelerates the onset of lactogenesis II and increases milk volume in first-time mothers after cesarean delivery. These results align with previous studies indicating the benefits of acupuncture and manual therapies in enhancing lactation. The study's strengths include its randomized controlled design and rigorous outcome assessment. However, limitations such as the inability to blind participants and the single-center setting should be considered when interpreting the results.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Integrating press needle acupuncture and breast massage into postnatal care protocols for cesarean-delivered mothers may offer a viable strategy to improve lactation outcomes and maternal health. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term effects and potential mechanisms underlying these interventions.</p>
